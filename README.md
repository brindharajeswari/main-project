# Introduction
This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses. The game is designed to be played by two players, taking turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid until one of them wins or the game ends in a draw.

# How to play
The game can be played by two players, one using X and the other using O. The players take turns placing their mark on the game board, trying to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game can be started by opening the index.html file in your web browser. Click on any empty cell to place your mark. The game will automatically alternate between the X and O players. If a player gets three in a row, the game will announce the winner. If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game will end in a draw.

To play again, click the "Restart" button.
